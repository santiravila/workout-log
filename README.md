# Workout Tracker CLI

## Description
This project is a command-line application written in Python that allows users to track workout routines, log training sessions, and generate performance reports over time.

Users can:
- Create workout routines with exercises, sets, and rest times
- Log workout sessions based on existing routines
- Persist data locally using JSON
- Filter sessions by routine
- Generate visual performance reports using matplotlib

The application follows an MVC-style architecture to separate domain logic and user interaction.

## Files

- `project.py`  
  Entry point of the application. Handles the main menu loop.

- `models.py`  
  Contains domain models (`Routine`, `Session`, `Exercise`) and service classes responsible for business logic and persistence.

- `views.py`  
  Handles user input, CLI output (using Rich), and data visualization with matplotlib.

- `controller.py`  
  Initializes and exposes the central `AppManager`.

- `test_project.py`  
  Unit tests for core functionality.

## How to Run

1. Create and activate a virtual environment 
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run de application:
```python
    `python project.py`
```

## Testing 
Run tests using:
pytest

## Design Notes

Data is persisted locally using JSON files

Business logic is kept separate from user interaction

Reports are generated by interpreting existing session data rather than storing derived values

This project was developed incrementally over several weeks
